An example [bpmnlint](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmnlint) plug-in.


## About

This plugin shows how to contribute [rules](#add-rules) and
[configuration](#add-configuration) to bpmnlint.


## Add Rules

The [`./rules`](./rules) folder contains rules that are made available via
this plug-in. Configure them with the `example` prefix in your `.bpmnlintrc`:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "example/no-manual-task": "warn"
  }
}
```

Checkout [`./test.js`](./test.js) to learn how to test your rules.


## Add Configuration

As part of the [`./index.js`](./index.js) the plug-in exposes configurations
to extend from using `extends` in the bpmnlint configuration:

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "bpmnlint:recommended",
    "plugin:example/recommended"
  ]
}
```

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - canvg-browser@1.0.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# canvg-browser

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bpmn-io/canvg-browser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bpmn-io/canvg-browser)

A port of [canvg](http://gabelerner.github.io/canvg) that properly works in the browser as CommonJS module.


## Differences to [canvg](http://gabelerner.github.io/canvg)

* Exposes CommonJS module
* Dependencies such as `rgbcolor` and `stackblur` are required in the CommonJS way, too
* Test cases verify this project works in the browser


## Installation
`npm install canvg-browser --save`


## Usage
Put a canvas on your page:

```html
<canvas id="canvas" width="200px" height="200px"></canvas>
```

```js
var canvg = require('canvg-browser'),
    canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');

var svg = '<svg height="100" width="100"><circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" /></svg>';

var options = {
  log: false,
  ignoreMouse: true
};

canvg(canvas, svg, options);
```


### Options

* log: true => console.log information
* ignoreMouse: true => ignore mouse events
* ignoreAnimation: true => ignore animations
* ignoreDimensions: true => does not try to resize canvas
* ignoreClear: true => does not clear canvas
* offsetX: int => draws at a x offset
* offsetY: int => draws at a y offset
* scaleWidth: int => scales horizontally to width
* scaleHeight: int => scales vertically to height
* renderCallback: function => will call the function after the first render is completed
* forceRedraw: function => will call the function on every frame, if it returns true, will redraw
* useCORS: true => will attempt to use CORS on images to not taint canvas

You can call canvg without parameters to replace all svg images on a page. See the [example](http://gabelerner.github.io/canvg/examples/convert.htm).

There is also a built in extension method to the canvas context to draw svgs similar to the way [drawImage](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#dom-context-2d-drawimage) works:
```javascript
var c = document.getElementById('canvas');
var ctx = c.getContext('2d');
ctx.drawSvg(SVG_XML_OR_PATH_TO_SVG, dx, dy, dw, dh);
```

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - cli-table@0.3.1

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

CLI Table [![NPM Version](http://badge.fury.io/js/cli-table.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/cli-table) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Automattic/cli-table.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/Automattic/cli-table)
=========

This utility allows you to render unicode-aided tables on the command line from
your node.js scripts.

![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/sYq4T.png)

## Features

- Customizable characters that constitute the table.
- Color/background styling in the header through
  [colors.js](http://github.com/marak/colors.js)
- Column width customization
- Text truncation based on predefined widths
- Text alignment (left, right, center)
- Padding (left, right)
- Easy-to-use API

## Installation

```bash    
npm install cli-table
```

## How to use

### Horizontal Tables
```javascript
var Table = require('cli-table');

// instantiate
var table = new Table({
    head: ['TH 1 label', 'TH 2 label']
  , colWidths: [100, 200]
});

// table is an Array, so you can `push`, `unshift`, `splice` and friends
table.push(
    ['First value', 'Second value']
  , ['First value', 'Second value']
);

console.log(table.toString());
```

### Vertical Tables
```javascript
var Table = require('cli-table');
var table = new Table();

table.push(
    { 'Some key': 'Some value' }
  , { 'Another key': 'Another value' }
);

console.log(table.toString());
```
### Cross Tables
Cross tables are very similar to vertical tables, with two key differences:

1. They require a `head` setting when instantiated that has an empty string as the first header
2. The individual rows take the general form of { "Header": ["Row", "Values"] }

```javascript
var Table = require('cli-table');
var table = new Table({ head: ["", "Top Header 1", "Top Header 2"] });

table.push(
    { 'Left Header 1': ['Value Row 1 Col 1', 'Value Row 1 Col 2'] }
  , { 'Left Header 2': ['Value Row 2 Col 1', 'Value Row 2 Col 2'] }
);

console.log(table.toString());
```

### Custom styles
The ```chars``` property controls how the table is drawn:
```javascript
var table = new Table({
  chars: { 'top': '═' , 'top-mid': '╤' , 'top-left': '╔' , 'top-right': '╗'
         , 'bottom': '═' , 'bottom-mid': '╧' , 'bottom-left': '╚' , 'bottom-right': '╝'
         , 'left': '║' , 'left-mid': '╟' , 'mid': '─' , 'mid-mid': '┼'
         , 'right': '║' , 'right-mid': '╢' , 'middle': '│' }
});

table.push(
    ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
  , ['frob', 'bar', 'quuz']
);

console.log(table.toString());
// Outputs:
//
//╔══════╤═════╤══════╗
//║ foo  │ bar │ baz  ║
//╟──────┼─────┼──────╢
//║ frob │ bar │ quuz ║
//╚══════╧═════╧══════╝
```

Empty decoration lines will be skipped, to avoid vertical separator rows just
set the 'mid', 'left-mid', 'mid-mid', 'right-mid' to the empty string:
```javascript
var table = new Table({ chars: {'mid': '', 'left-mid': '', 'mid-mid': '', 'right-mid': ''} });
table.push(
    ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
  , ['frobnicate', 'bar', 'quuz']
);

console.log(table.toString());
// Outputs: (note the lack of the horizontal line between rows)
//┌────────────┬─────┬──────┐
//│ foo        │ bar │ baz  │
//│ frobnicate │ bar │ quuz │
//└────────────┴─────┴──────┘
```

By setting all chars to empty with the exception of 'middle' being set to a
single space and by setting padding to zero, it's possible to get the most
compact layout with no decorations:
```javascript
var table = new Table({
  chars: { 'top': '' , 'top-mid': '' , 'top-left': '' , 'top-right': ''
         , 'bottom': '' , 'bottom-mid': '' , 'bottom-left': '' , 'bottom-right': ''
         , 'left': '' , 'left-mid': '' , 'mid': '' , 'mid-mid': ''
         , 'right': '' , 'right-mid': '' , 'middle': ' ' },
  style: { 'padding-left': 0, 'padding-right': 0 }
});

table.push(
    ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
  , ['frobnicate', 'bar', 'quuz']
);

console.log(table.toString());
// Outputs:
//foo        bar baz
//frobnicate bar quuz
```

## Usage

By popular demand, `colors` now ships with two types of usages!

The super nifty way

```js
var colors = require('colors');

console.log('hello'.green); // outputs green text
console.log('i like cake and pies'.underline.red) // outputs red underlined text
console.log('inverse the color'.inverse); // inverses the color
console.log('OMG Rainbows!'.rainbow); // rainbow
console.log('Run the trap'.trap); // Drops the bass

```

or a slightly less nifty way which doesn't extend `String.prototype`

```js
var colors = require('colors/safe');

console.log(colors.green('hello')); // outputs green text
console.log(colors.red.underline('i like cake and pies')) // outputs red underlined text
console.log(colors.inverse('inverse the color')); // inverses the color
console.log(colors.rainbow('OMG Rainbows!')); // rainbow
console.log(colors.trap('Run the trap')); // Drops the bass

```

I prefer the first way. Some people seem to be afraid of extending `String.prototype` and prefer the second way. 

If you are writing good code you will never have an issue with the first approach. If you really don't want to touch `String.prototype`, the second usage will not touch `String` native object.

## Disabling Colors

To disable colors you can pass the following arguments in the command line to your application:

```bash
node myapp.js --no-color
```

## Console.log [string substitution](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/console.html#console_console_log_data)

```js
var name = 'Marak';
console.log(colors.green('Hello %s'), name);
// outputs -> 'Hello Marak'
```

## Custom themes

### Using standard API

```js

var colors = require('colors');

colors.setTheme({
  silly: 'rainbow',
  input: 'grey',
  verbose: 'cyan',
  prompt: 'grey',
  info: 'green',
  data: 'grey',
  help: 'cyan',
  warn: 'yellow',
  debug: 'blue',
  error: 'red'
});

// outputs red text
console.log("this is an error".error);

// outputs yellow text
console.log("this is a warning".warn);
```

### Using string safe API

```js
var colors = require('colors/safe');

// set single property
var error = colors.red;
error('this is red');

// set theme
colors.setTheme({
  silly: 'rainbow',
  input: 'grey',
  verbose: 'cyan',
  prompt: 'grey',
  info: 'green',
  data: 'grey',
  help: 'cyan',
  warn: 'yellow',
  debug: 'blue',
  error: 'red'
});

// outputs red text
console.log(colors.error("this is an error"));

// outputs yellow text
console.log(colors.warn("this is a warning"));
```

*Protip: There is a secret undocumented style in `colors`. If you find the style you can summon him.*

## Why?
Have you ever seen that cool looking confetti on landing pages and above-the-fold content? We give you the power to create the same effect for free and without the hassle of having to design or code it from scratch.

## Installing/Using
### 📲 Downloading
- Using `npm`

  ```bash
    npm install confetti-js --save
  ```

- Direct download -> [click here](https://github.com/agezao/confetti-js/archive/master.zip)

### ➕ Add scripts
- The `classic` way
  ```html
  <script src="node_modules/confetti-js/dist/index.min.js"></script>
  ```

- ES6 module

  ```javascript
  // At the component you want to use confetti
  import ConfettiGenerator from "confetti-js";
  ```

### 🤔 How to use it?
After installing the plugin(the topic above), just call-it passing your options:

```html
<canvas id="my-canvas"></canvas>
```

#### javascript
```javascript
var confettiSettings = { target: 'my-canvas' };
var confetti = new ConfettiGenerator(confettiSettings);
confetti.render();
```

You can also pass a canvas element as the target:
```javascript
var confettiElement = document.getElementById('my-canvas');
var confettiSettings = { target: confettiElement };
var confetti = new ConfettiGenerator(confettiSettings);
confetti.render();
```

### React

```jsx
React.useEffect(() => {
  const confettiSettings = { target: 'my-canvas' };
  const confetti = new ConfettiGenerator(confettiSettings);
  confetti.render();

  return () => confetti.clear();
}, []) // add the var dependencies or not
```

done!

## Options

| Attribute | Description | Example value | Default value |
|---------------------------|-------------|--------------------|---------|
| *`target`* | The Id tag or node of the canvas that will be used | 'my-canvas' | 'confetti-holder' |
| *`max`* | The number of props(confetti) to be rendered | 11 | 80 |
| *`size`* | Prop size | 1.8 | 1 |
| *`animate`* | If the confetti should fall | false | true |
| *`respawn`* | If the confetti should be recreated after going off-screen | false | true |
| *`clock`* | The speed confetti fall | 50 | 25 |
| *`props`* | The type of props(confetti) that should be rendered. In addition to those listed in the default, there's a special "svg" type which requires further configuration and is detailed below. | ['circle', 'square'] | ['circle', 'square', 'triangle', 'line'] |
| *`colors`* | The color to be rendered on the confetti. By default, RGB format inside an array. | [[0,0,0], [255,255,255]] | [[165,104,246],[230,61,135],[0,199,228],[253,214,126]] |
| *`start_from_edge`* | Whether the confettis should fall from the top of the screen (or should move up from the bottom) | true | false |
| *`width`* | Canvas width | 960 | *window size* |
| *`height`* | Canvas height | 767 | *window height* |
| *`rotate`* | If set to `true`, SVG and squares will rotate while falling. | `true` | `false` |

### Special SVG particle type

There is an extra special partical type ("prop") which allows you to render SVGs as confetti particles. For example:

```json
{
  "props": [
    "circle",
    "square",
    { "type": "svg", "src": "site/hat.svg" }
  ]
}
```

You must specify the `type` and `src` properties. There are also a few other configuration properties available to SVG objects:


| Attribute | Description | Example value | Default value |
|---------------------------|-------------|--------------------|---------|
| *`size`* | Set the size of the SVG when it renders as a particle. | `25` | `15` |
| *`weight`* | The probability of this particle being rendered, where 1 is a regular weight, and 0.1 is uncommon. | `0.5` | `1` |

## API
Using the object generated by `new ConfettiGenerator()` is pretty easy, there're just two main methods actually.

| Method | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| *`render`* | Render the confetti at the config `<canvas/>` |
| *`clear`* | Clear the `<canvas/>` where the confetti where rendered |

```javascript
var confetti = new ConfettiGenerator();
confetti.render();
//
confetti.clear();
```

import {
  Graph,
  div_astar
} from 'div-top-k';

const testVertice2 = [];
testVertice2.push([0, 10]);
testVertice2.push([1, 9]);
testVertice2.push([2, 8]);
testVertice2.push([3, 7]);
testVertice2.push([4, 6]);
const eTable2 = [
  [1, 3, 4],
  [0, 2],
  [1, 3, 4],
  [0, 2],
  [0, 2],
];
const g2 = new Graph(testVertice2, eTable2);
div_astar(g2, 5).toString();
```

Your favourite module bundler should apply tree-shaking to only include the components your application requires. If you're using CommonJS modules give [common-shake](https://github.com/indutny/common-shake) a try.

  var el = domify('<p>Hello <em>there</em></p>');
  document.body.appendChild(el);
});
```

You can also run it in *node* and *iojs*. Just pass a custom implementation of `document`:

var jsdom = require('jsdom').jsdom();

domify('<p>Hello <em>there</em></p>', jsdom.defaultView.document);
```

## Running tests

```
$ npm test
```

# Mitt

> Tiny 200b functional event emitter / pubsub.

-   **Microscopic:** weighs less than 200 bytes gzipped
-   **Useful:** a wildcard `"*"` event type listens to all events
-   **Familiar:** same names & ideas as [Node's EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter)
-   **Functional:** methods don't rely on `this`
-   **Great Name:** somehow [mitt](https://npm.im/mitt) wasn't taken

Mitt was made for the browser, but works in any JavaScript runtime. It has no dependencies and supports IE9+.

## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

```sh
$ npm install --save mitt
```

Then with a module bundler like [rollup](http://rollupjs.org/) or [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), use as you would anything else:

```javascript
// using ES6 modules
import mitt from 'mitt'

// using CommonJS modules
var mitt = require('mitt')
```

The [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/mitt/dist/mitt.umd.js"></script>
```

You can find the library on `window.mitt`.

## Usage

```js
import mitt from 'mitt'

const emitter = mitt()

// listen to an event
emitter.on('foo', e => console.log('foo', e) )

// listen to all events
emitter.on('*', (type, e) => console.log(type, e) )

// fire an event
emitter.emit('foo', { a: 'b' })

// working with handler references:
function onFoo() {}
emitter.on('foo', onFoo)   // listen
emitter.off('foo', onFoo)  // unlisten
```

### Typescript

```ts
import mitt from 'mitt';
const emitter: mitt.Emitter = mitt();
```
